    <h2>My project aims to explore the economic effects of COVID-19 and lockdowns.</h2>

<!--Chart 1, simple GDP growth chart-->

    <h3>I began with an exploration of GDP.</h3>

    <container class="body_container">
    
    <p>  This simple chart allows the user to assess GDP volatility in several nations.
        OECD data. The colab notebook is available 
        <a href="https://github.com/joesellis/joesellis.github.io/blob/main/ipynb/proj_gdp_cleaning.ipynb">here.</a>
    </p>
    <div class="gap-10"></div>
    
    <div class="charts2" id="chart30">
    
     <script>
         var myChart30 = "json/proj_chart1_gdp.json";
         vegaEmbed('#chart30', myChart30);
     </script>
    
    </div>

    <div class="gap-10"></div>

    <p>India seemed to have much greater volatility than other nations. China had its dip in GDP and subsequent rebound earlier than other nations.
Ideally, I would have investigated why some countries had more volatility in their GDP throughout COVID, and how some countries were able to limit damage to GDP growth.

<!--Chart 2, lockdown and unemployment-->

<h3>One might assume that the tighter the lockdown in a country, the more unemployment you would see.</h3>

<container class="body_container3">

<p> Oxford University produce a lockdown stringency index. I paired this with OECD unemployment data to look country by country and also on an entire OECD scale.
    The colab notebook is available <a href="https://github.com/joesellis/joesellis.github.io/blob/main/ipynb/proj_lockdown_vs_unemployment_cleaning.ipynb">here.</a>
</p>

<div class="gap-1"></div>

<p>Many countries maintain their unemployment levels throughout tough lockdowns. However, there are correlations in some nations (Columbia and the USA).</p>

<div class="gap-5"></div>

<div class="charts2" id="chart31">

 <script>
     var myChart31 = "json/proj_chart2_unemp_lockdown_oecd.json";
     vegaEmbed('#chart31', myChart31);
 </script>

</div>
<div class="gap-10"></div>
<p>I ran a <a href="https://github.com/joesellis/joesellis.github.io/blob/main/ipynb/proj_lockdown_vs_unemployment_cleaning.ipynb">polynomial regression</a>
    that shows a slight positive correlation between lockdown stringency and unemployment in the OECD. I would like to establish causality but there are just so many variables at play.

<!--Chart 4, economic indicators in the UK-->
<h3> Having looked at unemployment and lockdowns, I wanted to zoom in on the UK economy.</h3>

<container class="body_container">
    
    <p> This fully API driven chart looks at how economic indicators track vaccines and COVID hospitalisations in the UK.
        I felt it might be interesting to see how the economy reacts to vaccinations and COVID-19 hospitalisations.
        Online sales RSI seems to track COVID hospitalisations, one would assume this is because when hospitalisations increase, lockdown stringency increases, and consumers spend more online.
        Online sales RSI and vaccinations look to have a negative relationship.
        Online sales RSI and wage growth look to have a negative relationship.
