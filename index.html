    <h3>Covid-19</h3>

    <p>The first chart tracks Covid-19 cases by UK region.</p>

<!--Vega embed, with notes for what is going on-->
<div class="chart" id="firstChart">

  <script>
    // Following the script tag we are using Javascript.
    // One way to tell is to see how comments work...
    // First job is to set the chart as a JS variable:
    var myChart1 = "chart1_covidUKRegions.json";
    // Now we simply insert it, using Vega's embed code:
    // The embed function needs to be told the location, and what to put there.

  <h3>The UK productivity puzzle</h3>

  <p>My second chart looks at productivity in the UK. Interestingly, productivity growth slowed down in 2006 and has not recovered.</p>

<div class="chart" id="secondChart">
  <script>
    var myChart2 = "chart2_ukProductivity.json";
    vegaEmbed('#secondChart', myChart2);
  </script>
</div>
    
      <h3>My third chart tracks the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin remains top dog. This chart was taken from the <a href="https://rapidcharts.io">rapid charts</a> website.</p>
    
<div class="chart" id="thirdChart">
  <script>
    var myChart3 = "RD_Top10_Cryptos.json";
    vegaEmbed('#thirdChart', myChart3);
  </script>
</div>
    
     <h3>COVID-19 cases in 3 UK regions</h3>
    
    <p>The fourth chart tracks Covid-19 cases in Bristol, Brighton, and Swindon using a live API</p>

<!--Vaga embed, with notes for what is going on-->
<div class="chart" id="fourthChart">

  <script>
    // Following the script tag we are using Javascript.
    // One way to tell is to see how comments work...
    // First job is to set the chart as a JS variable:
    var myChart4 = "API_Chart_Week2_JE.json";
    // Now we simply insert it, using Vega's embed code:
    // The embed function needs to be told the location, and what to put there. 
    vegaEmbed('#fourthChart', myChart4);
  </script>

  <p>My fifth chart also does this, using a stored CSV file. It doesn't appear to be doing a very good job...</p>

<div class="chart" id="fifthChart">
  <script>
    var myChart5 = "CSV_Chart2.json";
